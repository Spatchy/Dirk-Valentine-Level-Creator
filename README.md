## Sharing Levels
If you would like to share levels, export your project as a .dvpack file. You can then share it in the `#dvlc-level-share` channel in [my discord](https://discord.gg/aVFHHwK3)

## Contributing
**If you are a developer and would like to contribute to the project:**
- You need to have Node.JS installed
- simply pull the repo and run `npm install`, all dependencies will be installed
- to run the program in your dev environment run `npm run start`
- if you want to build an executable run `npm run make` - there is currently an issue which means you will have to install node modules in the `resources/app` folder yourself.
